Avenx-JS uses structured error codes starting with `AVX_C` for compiler errors and `AVX_R` for runtime issues.

## The `AvenxError` Class

Every runtime error code in this guide (e.g. `AVX_R01`) is ultimately thrown as an instance of `AvenxError`, a custom error class exported from the framework's runtime module. It extends the native `Error` and pairs a structured `code` with a formatted, human-readable `message`. Understanding this class is useful if you're writing custom guards, components, or services and want to throw or catch framework-consistent errors yourself.

### Constructor

```
new AvenxError(code, ...args)
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                                                                                          |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `code`    | `string` | One of the `AvenxErrorCodes` identifiers (e.g. `'AVX_R01'`). Selects which message template is used. |
| `...args` | `any[]`  | Values substituted into the message template's `{0}`, `{1}`, etc. placeholders, in order.            |

### Public Properties

| Property  | Type     | Description                                                                                                                  |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `code`    | `string` | The raw error code passed to the constructor (e.g. `'AVX_R01'`).                                                             |
| `message` | `string` | The fully formatted message, prefixed with the code, e.g. `[AVX_R01] Mount target selector "#app" was not found in the DOM.` |
| `name`    | `string` | Always `'AvenxError'`. Useful for distinguishing it from other `Error` subclasses in a `catch` block.                        |

### Importing

```js
import { AvenxError, AvenxErrorCodes } from 'avenx-js';
```

### Throwing an `AvenxError`

```js
import { AvenxError, AvenxErrorCodes } from 'avenx-js';

function mount(selector) {
  const target = document.querySelector(selector);
  if (!target) {
    throw new AvenxError(AvenxErrorCodes.MOUNT_TARGET_NOT_FOUND, selector);
  }
  // ...
}
```

### Catching and Inspecting an `AvenxError`

```js
import { AvenxError, AvenxErrorCodes } from 'avenx-js';

try {
  mount('#app');
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof AvenxError) {
    console.error(`Avenx error [${err.code}]:`, err.message);

    if (err.code === AvenxErrorCodes.MOUNT_TARGET_NOT_FOUND) {
      // Handle this specific failure mode
    }
  } else {
    throw err; // Not an Avenx-specific error, rethrow
  }
}
```

> **Tip:** Branch on `err.code`, not `err.message` — `code` is a stable identifier, while the formatted message text may change between versions.

### Non-throwing formatting with `formatMessage`

To get the same formatted error string without throwing (for example, to log a warning), use the exported `formatMessage` helper. It applies the same code-to-template lookup and placeholder substitution as the `AvenxError` constructor:

```js
import { formatMessage, AvenxErrorCodes } from 'avenx-js';

console.warn(formatMessage(AvenxErrorCodes.SANDBOX_VIOLATION, 'disallowed eval() call'));
// -> "[AVX_R15] Sandbox security violation: disallowed eval() call"
```

## Compiler Codes (`AVX_C*`)

| Code        | Default Message                                                                             | Cause & Resolution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `[AVX_C03]` | Duplicate component name(s) detected. These files compile to the same class name: {details} | **Cause:** Two or more component files (e.g. `card.component.js` in different directories) resolve to the same generated class name, since Avenx-JS derives a component's class name from its file name. This causes a naming collision when the components are bundled together.<br />**Resolution:** Rename one of the conflicting files, or move it to a location that produces a distinct class name — for example, renaming `card.component.js` to `profile-card.component.js`. The build halts and lists every conflicting file path so you can identify exactly which components need to be renamed. |

## Compiler Warnings

Unlike the error codes above, which halt compilation, Avenx-JS also emits **warnings** during the build step. Warnings do not stop the build, but they flag potential mistakes in your templates that are worth fixing.

### Undeclared Variable or Method Warning

```text
[Avenx Validation Warning] Undeclared variable or method "x" referenced in template.
```

**Cause:** During compilation, the `validateTemplate` function (in `ComponentParser.js`) scans every template for identifiers used in interpolations (`{{ }}`), bindings (`data-ax-bind`), loops (`<@for>`), and event handlers, then cross-checks each one against everything declared in the component's `state`, `computed`, `actions`, and `bridges`. If a variable or method is referenced in the template but isn't declared in any of these sources, Avenx-JS emits this warning at compile time.

This typically happens for a few common reasons:

- A typo in the variable or method name (e.g. `{{ state.usernmae }}` instead of `{{ state.username }}`).
- Forgetting to declare a new property in `state` or `computed` before referencing it in the template.
- Referencing a method in an event handler (e.g. `onclick="handleSubmit"`) that was never added to `actions`.
- Referencing a bridge that wasn't registered.

**Resolution:** To resolve this warning:

1. Double-check the spelling of the identifier in your template against its declaration in the component script.
2. Make sure the variable or method is actually declared under `state`, `computed`, `actions`, or `bridges` — not just used implicitly.
3. If the identifier is intentionally dynamic (e.g. supplied only at runtime through a bridge that isn't statically known to the parser), you can safely ignore the warning, though most cases indicate a genuine bug.

This validation exists purely to help catch mistakes early — it will not prevent your app from compiling or running, but an undeclared reference will typically resolve to `undefined` at runtime, so it's best to address the warning rather than ignore it.
### AVX_W17 — SECURITY_SANITIZED_ATTRIBUTE

```text
[Avenx Validation Warning] Sanitized attribute "{0}" when stripping content.
```

**Cause:** This warning is emitted when Avenx's HTML sanitizer detects an unsafe HTML attribute or URI while processing templates or raw values. To protect applications from Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, the sanitizer removes dangerous inline event handler attributes (such as `onclick`, `onload`, and `onerror`) and unsafe URI protocols (such as `javascript:`) before rendering.

**Impact:** Unsafe attributes and protocol URIs can allow arbitrary JavaScript execution in the browser, creating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Sanitizing these values helps prevent malicious code from being executed.

**Resolution:** To resolve this warning:

1. Remove inline event handler attributes such as `onclick`, `onload`, and `onerror`.
2. Avoid using `javascript:` or other unsafe URI protocols in attributes such as `href` or `src`.
3. Attach event handlers using the framework's supported event binding mechanism or standard JavaScript event listeners.
4. Sanitize any user-provided HTML before rendering it.

**Incorrect**

```html
<img src="image.png" onerror="alert('XSS')">

<a href="javascript:alert('Hello')">Click me</a>
```

**Correct**

```js
button.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
```

```html
<a href="/dashboard">Dashboard</a>
```

> **Note:** This warning indicates that Avenx removed one or more unsafe attributes during sanitization. Although the application can continue running, the affected attribute will not be rendered. Review the source HTML and replace unsafe attributes with secure alternatives.

### AVX_W18 — RENDER_LIST_EVALUATION_FAILED

**Warning Message**

```
Failed to evaluate list expression: {0}. Error: {1}
```

**Cause:** This warning is emitted at runtime when Avenx-JS attempts to evaluate a dynamic list expression used in `<@for>` or `data-ax-for`, but the expression throws an exception or does not resolve to a valid iterable. This commonly occurs when the referenced variable is `undefined`, `null`, not an array or iterable, or when the expression itself contains an error.

**Resolution:** To resolve this warning:

1. Ensure the list variable is declared before it is used in the template.
2. Verify that the evaluated value is an array or another iterable object.
3. Check for typographical errors in variable or property names.
4. Initialize dynamic lists with an empty array when data may not yet be available.
5. If the list depends on asynchronous data, ensure the data has loaded before rendering.

**Incorrect**

```javascript
const state = {};
```

```html
<@for="user in state.users">
  {{ user.name }}
</@for>
```

Since `state.users` is `undefined`, the renderer cannot evaluate the list expression.

**Correct**

```javascript
const state = {
  users: []
};
```

```html
<@for="user in state.users">
  {{ user.name }}
</@for>
```

**Defensive Example**

```javascript
const users = Array.isArray(state.users)
  ? state.users
  : [];
```

Using a default empty array ensures that the renderer always receives a valid iterable and prevents evaluation failures.


### AVX_W20 — RENDER_LIST_DUPLICATE_KEY

```text
[Avenx Validation Warning] Duplicate key "{0}" detected in list expression "{1}". Appending index suffix to prevent node reuse conflict.
```

**Cause:** This warning is emitted when multiple items rendered from the same list evaluate to the same key. Avenx uses keys to uniquely identify list elements during updates. When duplicate keys exist, the renderer cannot reliably determine which DOM node belongs to which item.

**Impact:** Duplicate keys can cause incorrect DOM node reuse, stale UI updates, or unexpected rendering behavior because the renderer can no longer reliably associate DOM nodes with their corresponding data items.

**Resolution:** To resolve this warning:

1. Use a property that is guaranteed to be unique for every item (for example, a database ID or UUID).
2. Ensure your source data does not contain duplicate identifiers.
3. Avoid using values that may repeat across list items.

**Incorrect**

```js
const users = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice' },
  { id: 1, name: 'Bob' }
];

users.map(user => (
  <UserCard key={user.id} />
));
```

**Correct**

```js
const users = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bob' }
];

users.map(user => (
  <UserCard key={user.id} />
));
```

> **Note:** When duplicate keys are detected, Avenx automatically appends the item's index to the duplicate key so rendering can continue. This is a fallback mechanism and should not be relied upon as a substitute for stable, unique keys.

### AVX_W21 — DIRECTIVE_HTML_EVALUATION_FAILED

**Warning Message**
Failed to evaluate data-ax-html: {0}. Error: {1}

**Cause:** This warning is emitted at runtime when Avenx-JS attempts to evaluate the expression bound to a `data-ax-html="..."` directive, but the expression throws an exception during evaluation. Since `data-ax-html` injects raw HTML directly into the DOM, any error in the underlying expression — such as referencing an undefined variable, calling a method that doesn't exist, or a malformed expression — prevents the directive from resolving to a valid HTML string.

This typically happens for a few common reasons:

- The bound expression references a variable or property that is `undefined` or `null` at the time of evaluation.
- A method called within the expression throws internally (e.g. a formatting or sanitization helper failing on unexpected input).
- Asynchronous data the expression depends on hasn't loaded yet.
- A typo or syntax error in the expression itself.

**Resolution:** To resolve this warning:

1. Ensure the variable or property bound to `data-ax-html` is declared and initialized before the directive evaluates.
2. Guard against `undefined`/`null` values with a fallback, e.g. an empty string.
3. Wrap any custom formatting or sanitization logic in a `try...catch` so failures degrade gracefully instead of throwing during evaluation.
4. If the HTML content depends on asynchronous data, initialize the bound property with a safe default (empty string) until the data has loaded.
5. Avoid embedding complex logic directly in the `data-ax-html` expression — compute the HTML string in a `computed` property instead, where it's easier to test and guard.

**Incorrect**

```javascript
const state = {};
```

```html
<div data-ax-html="state.description.toUpperCase()"></div>
```

Since `state.description` is `undefined`, calling `.toUpperCase()` on it throws, and the directive fails to evaluate.

**Correct**

```javascript
const state = {
  description: ''
};
```

```html
<div data-ax-html="state.description"></div>
```

**Defensive Example**

```javascript
const computed = {
  safeDescription() {
    return typeof state.description === 'string' ? state.description : '';
  }
};
```

```html
<div data-ax-html="computed.safeDescription"></div>
```

Deriving the value through a guarded `computed` property ensures `data-ax-html` always receives a valid string and prevents evaluation failures.

### AVX_W22 — DIRECTIVE_SHOW_EVALUATION_FAILED

**Warning Message**
Failed to evaluate data-ax-show: {0}. Error: {1}

**Cause:** This warning is emitted at runtime when Avenx-JS attempts to evaluate the condition bound to a `data-ax-show="..."` directive, but the expression throws an exception. Since `data-ax-show` toggles an element's visibility based on the truthiness of the evaluated expression, any error during evaluation — such as accessing a property on `null`/`undefined`, calling an undeclared method, or a malformed expression — prevents the renderer from determining whether the element should be shown or hidden.

This typically happens for a few common reasons:

- The bound expression accesses a nested property on a value that is `null` or `undefined` (e.g. `state.user.isActive` when `state.user` hasn't loaded yet).
- A method referenced in the expression was never declared in `actions` or `computed`.
- Asynchronous data the condition depends on hasn't resolved yet.
- A typo or syntax error in the expression itself.

**Resolution:** To resolve this warning:

1. Ensure any object referenced in the expression is initialized before `data-ax-show` evaluates, even if just as an empty object or `null` with a guarded check.
2. Guard nested property access with optional chaining or an explicit check, e.g. `state.user && state.user.isActive`.
3. If the condition depends on asynchronous data, default it to `false` until the data has loaded so the element stays hidden safely.
4. Move complex conditions into a `computed` property, where the logic is easier to guard and test.

**Incorrect**

```javascript
const state = {};
```

```html
<div data-ax-show="state.user.isActive">Welcome back!</div>
```

Since `state.user` is `undefined`, accessing `.isActive` throws, and the directive fails to evaluate.

**Correct**

```javascript
const state = {
  user: null
};
```

```html
<div data-ax-show="state.user && state.user.isActive">Welcome back!</div>
```

**Defensive Example**

```javascript
const computed = {
  isUserActive() {
    return Boolean(state.user && state.user.isActive);
  }
};
```

```html
<div data-ax-show="computed.isUserActive">Welcome back!</div>
```

Deriving the condition through a guarded `computed` property ensures `data-ax-show` always receives a safe boolean and prevents evaluation failures.

| `[AVX_R11]` | STATE_MUTATION_IN_UPDATE: Synchronous state mutation detected during component update.  | **Cause:** Modifying reactive state synchronously inside a template expression, computed property, or `onUpdate` hook causes the runtime to re-trigger the same update cycle, resulting in an infinite update/render loop.<br />**Resolution:** Never mutate state directly inside templates or computed getters. If a side-effect state change is required after an update, defer it asynchronously (e.g. `setTimeout(() => { this.state.value = newValue; }, 0)`) or derive the value through a computed property instead. |
| `[AVX_R12]` | Error in component "{name}" during lifecycle hook "{hook}": {error}                     | **Cause:** An unhandled error was thrown inside a component lifecycle hook (`onMount`, `onUpdate`, or `onUnmount`).<br />**Resolution:** Wrap lifecycle hook logic in a `try...catch` block, inspect the hook implementation for bugs, and ensure asynchronous operations properly handle rejected promises.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `[AVX_R13]` | DOM parsing failed due to malformed HTML. Parser error: {error}. HTML context: "{html}" | **Cause:** DOM parsing failed due to malformed HTML in component templates or dynamically rendered content (e.g., unclosed tags or mismatched elements).<br />**Resolution:** Verify your template HTML is well-formed. Ensure all elements are properly nested and all tags are closed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `[AVX_R14]` | ROUTER_GUARD_TIMEOUT: A route guard exceeded the configured timeout duration.           | **Cause:** One or more sequential route guards returned promises that failed to resolve within the configured timeout period, causing navigation transitions to stall.<br />**Resolution:** Inspect route guard logic for unresolved or hanging promises. Optimize long-running asynchronous operations, ensure all promises properly resolve or reject, or adjust the `guardTimeout` configuration if longer execution times are expected.                                                                                  |
| `[AVX_R15]` | SANDBOX_VIOLATION: A sandbox security violation occurred.                               | **Cause:** Template or runtime expressions attempted to access restricted properties such as `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype`, or unauthorized global variables. This restriction prevents prototype pollution, template injection, and unauthorized global scope access.<br />**Resolution:** Restrict expressions to authorized variables only. Avoid accessing or modifying prototype-related properties and unauthorized globals. If necessary, wrap values securely before exposing them to expressions.      |
| `[AVX_R16]` | Cannot reassign component state directly.                                               | **Cause:** Assigning a new object to `this.state`, such as `this.state = { count: 1 }`, replaces the reactive Proxy and breaks change detection.<br />**Resolution:** Mutate properties on the existing state object instead, such as `this.state.count = 1`, or update several properties with `Object.assign(this.state, { count: 1 })`.                                                                                                                    |
